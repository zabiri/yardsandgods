        <p className="About__container-paragraph">Yards & Gods was a mixed-media collective based in Columbia, MO from 2006-2013. We created a lot of beautiful things together, and I still consider Y&G folks family... But people come and go, and eventually that story came to an end.</p>
        <p className="About__container-paragraph">Yards & Gods lives on in spirit here in this North Columbia home studio where many of the same voices (as well as plenty of new ones) can still be heard in the musicians that record here.</p>
        <h1 className="About__container-header">About the Engineer</h1>
        <p className="About__container-paragraph">My name is Zach Biri. I am a/an: audio engineer, musician, audiophile, web developer, technophile, cat enthusiast, dabbler in mixed digital media, trekkie, etc... I operate a modest digital recording studio (sorry analog purists! someday...) out of my home in Columbia, MO for reasonable rates (inquire below!). I've been recording and engineering live sound for over half of my life.</p>
