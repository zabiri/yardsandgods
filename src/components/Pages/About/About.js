        <p className="About__container-paragraph">
          Yards & Gods is a multimedia studio. While the primary focus is music
          (recording, mixing, mastering), I also work on film audio, video
          editing, animation, and 3D modeling.
        </p>
        <p className="About__container-paragraph">
          Yards & Gods was also a mixed-media collective based in Columbia, MO
          from 2006-2013. We released dozens of records, a zine, screen prints,
          etc. Yards & Gods (the collective) still lives on in spirit, as many
          of the same talents can be heard on the records recorded here.
